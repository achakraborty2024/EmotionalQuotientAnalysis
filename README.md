**Emotion-Based Video Sequencing and Analysis**

This project demonstrates a pipeline for analyzing the emotional content of video scenes and sequencing them to create impactful narratives, particularly for short-form content. It utilizes facial landmark detection with MediaPipe, emotional scoring, and clustering techniques to determine an ideal scene order and predict potential viewer engagement. The notebook also explores generating creative suggestions and identifying key selling points for each scene.

**Project Overview**

The notebook covers the following key areas:

- Data Preparation: Generating or loading data that associates video files with emotional scores.
- Emotional Analysis: Calculating and visualizing the average emotional profile of the video collection.
- Video Sequencing: Implementing different methods (narrative arc and clustering) to sequence videos based on emotional flow.
- Content Enhancement: Providing suggestions for improving scenes and identifying key moments.
- Viewer Insights: Predicting viewer preferences based on the emotional content and calculating scene selling points.
- Evaluation (Attempted): Exploring methods to compare predicted engagement with real-world social media data.
